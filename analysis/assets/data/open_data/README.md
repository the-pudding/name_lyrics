## allNames.csv & allNames.R

  - `allNames.R`: The script used to process a file of song lyrics
    (that, due to copyright issues we can’t release), to create
    `allNames.csv`. Some manual cleaning was conducted on the data, as
    described below.

  - `allNames.csv`: The data, as described below
    
      - **What is this?**: A file containing each line of song lyrics in
        which a name was found
      - **Source(s) & Methods**: All songs used in this analysis were on
        the US Billboard Hot 100 list at least once since the chart’s
        inception in 1958. Song lyrics were obtained primarily through
        MetroLyrics. Many thanks to Colin Morris for providing lyric
        data for songs popular prior to 2017 (used in his project on
        repetition in pop music). Since these lyrics are user submitted,
        it is possibly (and even likely) that there are spelling errors
        that I was unable to compensate for. Over 15,000 songs that met
        the above criteria were analyzed, and of those, 5,195 contained
        a name (as defined below). To identify names in song lyrics, I
        used US national-level baby name data from the Social Security
        Administration (downloaded from Kaggle). Since there were over
        93,000 names in this dataset, I limited my search to just those
        names that have been used as names at least 5,000 times since
        the 1950’s. This resulted in 3,607 names. I then searched
        through the song lyrics for any instance of any name in this
        dataset. Using the R package udpipe, I tagged each name with a
        part of speech to eliminate uses of words that were used as
        verbs (e.g., Will the person vs. “I will do something”) or
        adjectives (e.g., “baby girl”). I intended to retain only names
        tagged as proper nouns, but since song lyrics are not always
        grammatically correct, part of speech tagging can be inaccurate.
        Thus, I also manually checked the data, removing instances of
        names that were not being used as proper nouns. There were a few
        other manual corrections made. Last names presented as surnames
        (e.g., “Kennedy” in “John F. Kennedy”) were removed, but if the
        surname stood on its own (e.g. “I am the realest since Kennedy”)
        it could have been referring to a first name, so it was
        retained. Names that appeared to refer to a non-person (e.g.,
        places, brands, drug references, colors, seasons, etc.) have
        been denoted in the `nonPerson` column. Double word names (e.g.,
        Barbara Ann) were adjusted manually to count as a single entity
        rather than counting as “Barbara” and “Ann”.
