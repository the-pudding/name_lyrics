[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira

[Verse 1]
Eyes that look like heaven, lips like cherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feeling, up and down my spine
Cause I know that my Elvira's mine
So I'm singin'

[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira

[Bridge]
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow, heigh-ho Silver, away

[Verse 2]
Tonight I'm gonna meet her, at the Hungry House Cafe
And I'm gonna give her all the love I can, yes I am
She's gonna jump and holler, cause I've saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man
And I'm singin'

[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira

[Bridge]
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow, heigh-ho Silver, away

[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira

[Bridge]
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow, heigh-ho Silver, away

[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira

[Bridge]
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow
Giddy up, oom poppa, omm poppa, mow mow, heigh-ho Silver, away

[Chorus]
Elvira, Elvira
My heart's on fire, for Elvira
